# ps2toolchain

This program will automatically build and install the compiler tools used in the creation of homebrew software for the Sony PlayStationÂ® 2 videogame system.

## **ATENTION!**

If you're trying to install in your machine the **WHOLE PS2 Development Environment** this is **NOT** the repo to use, you should use instead the [ps2dev](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2dev "ps2dev") repo.

## What these scripts do

These scripts download (with `wget`/`git clone`) and install:
- [binutils 2.14](http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/ "binutils") (iop, dvp)
- [binutils 2.35.1](http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/ "binutils") (ee), 
- [gcc 3.2.3](https://gcc.gnu.org/ "gcc") (iop)
- [gcc 10.2.0](https://gcc.gnu.org/ "gcc") (ee)
- [newlib 4.0.0](https://sourceware.org/newlib/ "newlib") (ee)

## Requirements

1. Install gcc/clang, make, patch, git, texinfo, flex, bison, wget, gsl, gmp, mpfr, mpc and gettext if you don't have those.

2. Ensure that you have enough permissions for managing PS2DEV location (default to `/usr/local/ps2dev`). PS2DEV location MUST NOT have spaces or special characters in it's path! For example on Linux systems you can set access for current user by running commands:
```bash
export PS2DEV=/usr/local/ps2dev
sudo mkdir -p $PS2DEV
sudo chown -R $USER: $PS2DEV
```

3. Add this to your login script (example: `~/.bash_profile`)  
```bash
export PS2DEV=/usr/local/ps2dev
export PS2SDK=$PS2DEV/ps2sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$PS2DEV/bin:$PS2DEV/ee/bin:$PS2DEV/iop/bin:$PS2DEV/dvp/bin:$PS2SDK/bin
```

4. Run toolchain.sh  
`./toolchain.sh`
